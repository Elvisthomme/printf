NAME
_printf

SYNOPSIS
#include "main.h"
int _printf(const char *format, ...)
int _printf_count(const char *format, int count, va_list ap)

DESCRIPTION

The function _printf is a variadic function that produces a string according to a
.I format
and prints it to the standard output, much like the C standard library function printf.
it can receive a variable number of arguments.
This function has been created for an ALX SE group project.

On success, _printf returns the number of characters printed. If format
is NULL or if the functions encounters any errors, it returns -1.

FORMAT OF THE STRING

The format string can contain any characters , just like a regular string, 
in double quotes, which will be printed as it is. For example, _printf(\(dqHello\(dq) will print: Hello.
However, this format string can contain conversion specifiers
These start with a %, and are followed with a character

CONVERSION SPECIFIERS

Special characters like a new line are escaped, for example _printf(\n) will print a new line.
> i, d
- Both these specifiers are for int arguments.
They conver the variable to decimal number, positive or negative.

>c
- Prints a single character.

>s
- Prints an entire string.

>u
- Prints an unsigned int.

>x, X
- Respectively print a number in lowercase and uppercase hexadecimal
>0,b

NOTES
_printf uses a custom character printing function called _putchar, that uses the system call write().
When _putchar is called inside _printf, the character is stored inside the buffer and the function moves to the next character,
until _printf calls _putchar(-1)
